# Operator guide — role-play → permission profiles

Backend only (2026-09-16); the frontend role menu is not built yet, so every step below is a `curl` call. See
`AI-Notes/handoffs/ROLEPLAY_PERMISSIONS_HANDOFF.md` for full state + the frontend spec, and ISLE_HARDENING_PLAN
§17b for the workflow. Examples use the home staging stack, `https://api.prf.192.168.0.210.nip.io`.

## 1. Dev posture
Role-play only works in dev posture (§16b); production refuses it outright. In `.generated/prod-answers.env` set
`POL_PROD_POSTURE=dev`, then `pol prod apply` (run detached: `setsid nohup pol prod apply > /tmp/x.log 2>&1 &`;
poll the log for "stack polari-lean deployed"). Back to production: `POL_PROD_POSTURE=production` + `pol prod apply`
again. Note `pol prod apply` REWRITES the answers file from its known keys, so set posture there, not ad hoc.

## 2. Recording on/off
Default ON in dev, never in production. `GET /api/security/observe` reports the knob + open sessions.
```
curl -sk -X POST https://api.prf.192.168.0.210.nip.io/api/security/observe -d '{"recording": false}'
```

## 3. Grant the role-play permission
Its own grant, separate from any one role: admins may always; a dev instance with no `roleplay_groups` set lets
EVERYONE role-play; a list restricts it to those KC groups (production always refuses regardless).
```
curl -sk -X POST https://api.prf.192.168.0.210.nip.io/api/security/observe -d '{"roleplay_groups": ["developers"]}'
```

## 4. Create a prototype role and act as it
```
curl -sk -X POST https://api.prf.192.168.0.210.nip.io/api/security/observe/roles \
  -d '{"name": "journalist", "title": "Journalist", "description": "reporter-facing pages only"}'
curl -sk -X POST https://api.prf.192.168.0.210.nip.io/api/security/observe/session -d '{"role": "journalist"}'
```
From here every request must carry `X-Polari-Roleplay: journalist` (`curl -H "X-Polari-Roleplay: journalist"`) so
the CRUDE gate attributes and records the act. Use the product as the role would, then end the session:
`curl -sk -X DELETE '…/observe/session?role=journalist'`. Once built: a header menu (upper right, next to login)
— "Acting as: <role>", a menu of prototype roles, Stop role-play, "New prototype role…" — visible only when
`can_roleplay` is true, absent in production.

## 5. Review
```
curl -sk 'https://api.prf.192.168.0.210.nip.io/api/security/observe/review?role=journalist'
```
Returns everything touched — apps, pages, components, actions, endpoints, objects×verbs, acts, `would_deny_today`
— plus a `proposed_profile` shaped like an `AppPermissionProfile`: `kc_groups_json` (the KC group(s) it maps to),
`verbs_json` (CRUDE verbs observed per class), `extra_classes_json` (classes outside the role's home app, for the
admin to judge in or out). A suggestion only — nothing is created until the admin acts.

## 6. Concrete it
The permissions admin narrows the proposal, creates the real `AppPermissionProfile` row via CRUDE, then:
```
curl -sk -X POST https://api.prf.192.168.0.210.nip.io/api/security/observe/roles/journalist \
  -d '{"state": "concreted", "profile": "journalist"}'
```
Enforce gradually: `POLARI_APP_PERMISSIONS=advisory` first (logs would-deny without denying), then `=enforce`.

## 7. Verify, then enforce
```
curl -sk 'https://api.prf.192.168.0.210.nip.io/api/security/observe/verify?role=journalist&group=journalist'
```
Replays every recorded class×verb through `permission_verdict` as a member of the group — allowed/denied per act.
A denial means the job would break under the new profile; widen and re-review before enforcing. Once clean:
```
curl -sk -X POST https://api.prf.192.168.0.210.nip.io/api/security/observe/roles/journalist -d '{"state": "enforced"}'
```

## Gotchas
- Only works in dev posture; a production-posture flip makes `can_roleplay` refuse outright — re-check
  `GET /api/security/observe/roles` after any posture change.
- Anonymous calls record as verdict `unauthenticated`, not against the role — need a real Keycloak login in the
  session for review to fill in meaningfully.
- The `app` column on `PermissionObservation` is still empty, so review's per-app grouping is incomplete.
- Rows must be constructed as tree objects; a stray fallback to a plain object breaks the class view
  (`PolyTyping for type SimpleNamespace`) — hit once on the live stack, fixed.
- Persistence is one trailing timer per burst; counts have been proven to survive a backend restart.
- `pol …` expands `$(...)` in remote commands locally — script remote nodes with `pol iso ssh … -- cmd`, plain.
