# Testing owed — tracker (written 2026-08-13, for Dustin's pass later today)

Everything below is BUILT and machine-verified as far as automation can
go; each item now needs a human, a credential, or a device. Ordered by
how much one sitting closes.

## 1. Meetings arc (mtg) — four blockers, ~1 hour with the right gear

From `MEETINGS_AND_RETICULUM_HANDOFF.md` §2; code all on `dev-mtg-1`
×4 repos, deployed to staging.

| # | Test | Needs | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Signed-in join** — real mic/camera + moderation against a live peer | Keycloak credentials | `/meetings` on staging |
| 2 | **Second-device join** — phone joins room `mtg1` | Dustin's phone | links in scratch rig `JOIN_LINKS.txt` (`…/scratchpad/mtg0-rig/`) |
| 3 | **Headset session** — immersive entry, avatar rendering | headset; expect the Wolvic + self-signed-CA trap | `/meetings` → XR entry |
| 4 | **3D drag gesture** — mtg-8 seam is proven server-side; the viewer interaction needs a design pass (what is draggable?) | Dustin's design input, then a build session | commit-drag → proposal (202) already live |

Everything up to the auth wall is verified; item 1 is the highest-value
single test (it exercises mtg-2/3/4/6 with a real user).

## 2. Standing review gates (older, still open)

- **dyn-1..9 (dynamic modules)** — backend complete + proven on
  `dev-dyn-1` (8 commits), NOT merged/pushed, explicit review gate.
  The mtg and ret work stack on it, so this review unblocks the most.
- **Push sweep** — CONSOLIDATION note: `push-all-dev.sh` ready
  (dry-run default); pushing is Dustin's manual step. Many arcs are
  "NOT pushed".
- **Wax-mold casting frontend** — cert-accept + `/casting` eyeball +
  wizard UI walkthrough (CASTING_FRONTEND_HANDOFF.md).
- **Climate app** — browser pass + graph tuning; re-ingest after any
  redeploy until the sqlite flush is fixed.
- **WebXR xr-1/2** — UNCOMMITTED, awaiting a headset session (can share
  the sitting with mtg item 3).

## 3. New tonight (Reticulum arc) — verification that will be owed

Filled in as the ret work lands; see `RETICULUM_TRANSPORT_PLAN.md`
status blocks for what was machine-proven vs. what awaits you.

- §6 answers were taken as ASSUMPTIONS (marked in the plan) — confirm
  or correct them; each one names its reversal cost.
- Hardware order: two RNode-flashable LoRa boards (~$20–40 each,
  LilyGO T-Beam/T3, Heltec LoRa32, RAK) — needed only as ret-6
  approaches, not before.
